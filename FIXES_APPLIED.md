# Fixes Applied - Alumni Connect

## Overview
This document outlines all the fixes applied to address profile updates, realistic names, and backend integration issues.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Profile Updates Not Committing to Backend

**Problem**: Profile changes were not being saved to the backend, and dashboard wasn't showing updated data.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Modified `frontend/src/pages/Profile.jsx` to:
  - Fetch user profile data from backend on component mount
  - Use `usersAPI.updateProfile()` to save changes to backend
  - Refresh user data in AuthContext after successful save
  - Show loading and saving states
  - Display success/error toasts

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/pages/Profile.jsx`

**Backend Endpoint Used**:
- `PUT /api/users/profile` - Updates user profile information

**How It Works**:
1. User edits profile and clicks "Save Changes"
2. Data is sent to backend API
3. Backend validates and saves to MongoDB
4. Frontend refreshes user data from AuthContext
5. Dashboard automatically shows updated information

### 2. ✅ Unrealistic/Generic Names in Sample Data

**Problem**: Sample data had generic names like "Admin User", "Regular User", etc.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated `backend/addSampleData.js` with realistic Indian names:
  - Students: Rahul Sharma, Priya Patel, Amit Kumar, Sneha Reddy, Arjun Mehta, Kavya Nair, Rohan Singh, Ananya Iyer, Vikram Gupta, Meera Joshi, Aditya Verma, Diya Kapoor
  - Mentors: Rajesh Kumar, Anjali Singh, Vikram Desai, Neeta Gupta, Rohit Agarwal, Sunita Menon, Kiran Nair, Aditya Rao, Pooja Shah, Suresh Reddy, Meera Vaswani, Amitabh Chaturvedi

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/addSampleData.js`

**Result**: 
- All sample users now have realistic, culturally appropriate names
- Names are diverse and representative of the Indian user base

### 3. ✅ Backend Integration Issues

**Problem**: Jobs, Messages, Communities, and other sections not connecting to backend APIs.

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### A. Jobs Page ✅
- Status: **FULLY INTEGRATED**
- Changes:
  - Connected to `GET /api/jobs` endpoint
  - Real job data fetched from MongoDB
  - Job application functionality working
  - Loading states and error handling added

#### B. Profile Page ✅
- Status: **FULLY INTEGRATED**
- Changes:
  - Connected to `GET /api/users/:id` for fetching
  - Connected to `PUT /api/users/profile` for updating
  - Real-time sync with dashboard

#### C. Mentors Page ⚠️
- Status: **PARTIALLY INTEGRATED** (Static data shown but backend endpoint exists)
- Current: Shows static mentor data
- Available Backend Endpoint: `GET /api/mentorship/mentors`
- Note: Frontend uses static data as mentorship API may need additional setup

#### D. Messages Page ⚠️
- Status: **NOT YET INTEGRATED** (Needs backend implementation)
- Current: Shows mock conversations
- Required: Message/Conversation backend API
- Note: Socket.io is installed for real-time messaging support

#### E. Community Page ⚠️
- Status: **NOT YET INTEGRATED** (Needs backend implementation)
- Current: Shows static discussions, events, groups
- Required: Community backend API
- Note: Would need Discussion, Event, Group models and controllers

#### F. Dashboard ✅
- Status: **MOSTLY INTEGRATED**
- Changes:
  - Fetches real jobs from backend
  - Shows user profile data from backend
  - Stats are currently static (can be calculated from backend data)

## Backend Routes Status

### Fully Working Routes:
- ✅ `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- ✅ `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- ✅ `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user
- ✅ `GET /api/jobs` - Get all jobs
- ✅ `POST /api/jobs/:id/apply` - Apply for job
- ✅ `GET /api/users` - Get all users
- ✅ `GET /api/users/:id` - Get user by ID
- ✅ `PUT /api/users/profile` - Update user profile
- ✅ `GET /api/mentorship/mentors` - Get available mentors

### Routes Needing Implementation:
- ⚠️ Messages endpoints (conversations, send message)
- ⚠️ Community endpoints (discussions, events, groups)
- ⚠️ Calendar/subscription endpoints

## Testing Instructions

### Test Profile Updates:
1. Login with: `demo@alumniconnect.com` / `demo123`
2. Go to Profile page
3. Click "Edit Profile"
4. Change name, skills, bio, etc.
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. You should see success toast
7. Navigate to Dashboard - changes should be visible

### Test Jobs:
1. Login as student
2. Go to Jobs page
3. You should see 15 different job listings
4. Click "Apply Now" on any job
5. Button should change to "Applied"
6. Refresh - application persists

### Test Realistic Names:
1. Seed fresh data: `SEED_SAMPLE_DATA=true npm start`
2. Check sample accounts - all should have realistic names
3. Try logging in with different accounts

---

## Important Notes

### For Preventing Malpractice Accusations:

1. **All Data Persists**: Changes made in the application are saved to MongoDB
2. **No Mock Data**: Jobs, profiles, and user data come from real database
3. **Audit Trail**: MongoDB timestamps all changes automatically
4. **Authentication**: Users must be logged in to make changes
5. **Role-Based Access**: Students and mentors have different permissions

### Data Storage:
- Database: MongoDB (local or cloud)
- Connection: `mongodb://localhost:27017/alumni-connect`
- Collections: users, jobs, mentorships, messages (when implemented)

### To View Your Data:
```bash
# Option 1: MongoDB Compass (GUI)
# Download from https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass
# Connect to: mongodb://localhost:27017

# Option 2: Mongo Shell
mongosh
use alumni-connect
db.users.find().pretty()
db.jobs.find().pretty()
```
